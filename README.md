# Airbnb Data Analysis Project


This project analyzes labeled data of Airbnb characteristics such as location, number of listings per owner, yearly availability, and walkability score and its pricing to develop a model that predicts Airbnb pricing. This data was then trained in several regression models to predict the prices. 

Inputs are csv files from Kaggel and walkability scores obtained through an API connection
