# Airbnb Data Analysis Project


This project analyzes labeled data about Airbnb characteristics such as location, number of listings per owner, yearly availability, and walkability score. This data was then trained in a linear regression model to predict the prices. The project predicts Airbnb pricing based on the training data provided.
